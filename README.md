# Nikul's MATLAB Garage

This repository contains MATLAB and Simulink projects, experiments, and reports collected under several mini-projects.

Top-level folders (high-level summary):

- (MINI_PROJECT_01) AUTOMOTIVE_FAN_CONTROL — Fan control Simulink models, harnesses and report PDFs
- (MINI_PROJECT_02) SEAT_BELT_WARNING_SYSTEM — Seatbelt warning Simulink models
- (MINI_PROJECT_03) HIGHWAY_ASISTANCE — Highway assistant / lane-keeping models and helpers
- (MINI_PROJECT_04) CRUIS_CONTROL — Cruise control models and reports
- (MINI_PROJECT_05) LEARN ABOUT MAAB GUIDLINE BASED ON RELA WORLD PROJECTS — TJA / AUTOSAR examples and generated code
- (MINI_PROJECT_06) WIPER_CONTROL — Wiper control models and results
- AUTOMOTIVE_MODELING_JMAAB — Additional JMAAB modeling reports and files
- slprj, _sfprj, and other generated build folders — Simulink build artifacts and reports (can be large)

How to clone:

    git clone https://github.com/PRAJAPATINIKUL8/Nikul-s-MATLAB-Garage.git

Notes:
- Many files are binary (Simulink .slx, generated C, .mat files). Use Git LFS if you plan to track large binaries or add them selectively.
- Remove or ignore build artifact folders like `slprj/` and `*_ert_rtw/` if you don't want to store generated code in the repo. Consider adding/updating `.gitignore` accordingly.

If you'd like, I can:
- add a simple `.gitignore` recommending ignoring build artifacts
- create a GitHub release tag (I can create `v1.0.0` now)
- open the repository in your browser
